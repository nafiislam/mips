ALU, Control_unit, Instruction_pc, Reg_file, memory

Each one of the unit named folders have c files that is flashed into Atmega32.

2. "Assembler for both s_w and h_w " is for translating misp codes into hardware binary codes
3. "4 bit computer - Sheet1.pdf", "4 bit computer.xlsx", "Archi.pdf" files are for overall plan of the architecture.
4. Main.circ is the logisim simulation of the implemented MIPS architecture
